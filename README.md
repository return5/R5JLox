This is My version of JLox from the book [craftinginterpreters.](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/)   
It is mostly the same as presented in the book, but I have made a few changes:  
- Integers:
  - int values are supported alongside doubles.
  - when doing math, if both operands are ints, then integer math is used, otherwise both operands are treated as doubles.
- String concatenation:  
  - concat is done using the `..` operator and not the `+`  operator.  
  - concat operator converts all operands to a String representation.  
- some keywords have been changed:  
  - var -> stash
  - class -> designation
  - func -> functi
  - print -> say
  - this -> self
- internal changes:  
  - code has been organized along a more java enterprise style of coding. perhaps to an excessive extent.
  - I used java 13 features such as enhanced switch and instanceof operators when applicable.
  - I used streams rather than loops where applicable.
  - reorganized some code to be in a separate method/class. reorganized some switch cases. did a few other small miscellaneous code changes.
  - overall, my code doesn't match 100% what is in the book,but the end result when running the interpreter is the same.   
- Implements anonymous functions:  
  - this is an optional challenge in the book, a basic Lox implementation might not implement this feature.
